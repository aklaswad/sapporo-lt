Web Music

Honestly, am sick of JavaScript versions of Csound, Max/MSP, SuperColider, etc...
am sick of Any clones of T*-(303|808|909), ChaosPad, Tenorion, etc...

What I want is music.
music which ever been until Web Music Technorogies has born.

Web Music technorogies can change web site experiences.

Is it enough?

I believe Web Music can change music itself.
Web Music has possibilities to enpower music experiences.

Be artist. Be musician.

Thank you.
